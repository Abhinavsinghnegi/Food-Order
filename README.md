# FoodOrder

FoodOrder is a web application that allows the user to choose or search a dish from a variety of dish, it also provides the feature to add dishes in cart and can proceed to checkout with all of them. 
It comes up with **Functionality** like :
- 'item not found' when the cart is empty.
- 'unkown request' when the user demands some irrelevant choice.
- 'nothing found' when something that is not there being searched.
- _tags_ are used so that similar kind of dishes are grouped together.
- increment in prices when we increase a particular dish number or add more dishes.

This is a front end web application made by the use of following technologies:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **TyprScript**
- **AngularJS**.

Future changes that will be done on this project would be the _authentication_ and _authorization_ of users and business so they can communicate easily and securely.
Also, connecting it to backend and with database would be the first priority of this project, it will be done with **nodeJS** and **mongoDB**.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
